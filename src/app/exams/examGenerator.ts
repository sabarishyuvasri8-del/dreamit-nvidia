BLUEPRINT & QUESTION DISTRIBUTION:

STRICT 100% MCQ REQUIREMENTS (MANDATORY):
1. EVERY SINGLE QUESTION WITHOUT EXCEPTION MUST BE A MULTIPLE CHOICE QUESTION (MCQ) WITH EXACTLY 4 OPTIONS: A, B, C, and D.
2. DO NOT GENERATE ANY OPEN-ENDED TEXT QUESTIONS, SHORT ANSWERS, OR ESSAYS.
3. Every MCQ must designate a "correctOption" ("A", "B", "C", or "D").
4. GENERATE ALL SECTIONS (Section A, Section B, Section C) COMPLETELY.
5. For Assertion-Reason questions in Section C, use official CBSE standard choices:
   - A: Both Assertion (A) and Reason (R) are true and Reason (R) is the correct explanation of Assertion (A).
   - B: Both Assertion (A) and Reason (R) are true but Reason (R) is not the correct explanation of Assertion (A).
   - C: Assertion (A) is true but Reason (R) is false.
   - D: Assertion (A) is false but Reason (R) is true.
6. Options must be authentic, plausible, and challenging.
7. Output VALID JSON ONLY without commentary or markdown code fences.
